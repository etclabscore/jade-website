# Developer Resources

<div class="featured">Guides, resources, and tools for developers building on OpenRPC.</div>

## Getting started

**If you’re new to developing with OpenRPC, you’re in the right place.** These projects and repositories are written by the OpenRPC community will introduce you to the basics of OpenRPC and introduce core concepts that might be different from other API development you’re familiar with.

Need a more basic non-technical primer first? Check out [open-rpc.org/learn.](/learn/)

## Specification

The specification for OpenRPC. A programming language and transport agnostic interface description for JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs.

[https://spec.open-rpc.org/](https://spec.open-rpc.org/)

[https://github.com/open-rpc/spec](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec)

## Playground

The OpenRPC playground a web IDE for developers to write their open-api based documents.

[https://playground.open-rpc.org/](https://playground.open-rpc.org/)

[https://github.com/open-rpc/playground](https://github.com/open-rpc/playground)

## Examples

This resource provides example open-rpc documents. Put one through the generator-client or playground!

[https://github.com/open-rpc/examples](https://github.com/open-rpc/examples)

## Client Generator

The client generator is a tool to build clients by simply passing an open-rpc document.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/generator-client](https://github.com/open-rpc/generator-client)

## Mock Server

Provides a mock JSON-RPC API with Service Discovery for a given OpenRPC document.

## Meta Schema

JSON Schema representation of the OpenRPC Specification.

## Server Js

JSON-RPC 2.0 Server implementation that supports multiple transport protocols.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/server-js](https://github.com/open-rpc/server-js)

## Client Js

A browser-compatible JSON-RPC client with multiple transports.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/client-js](https://github.com/open-rpc/client-js)

## Typings

CLI and Javascript/Typescript methods for generating types for your OpenRPC API.

## Schema Utils Js

Javascript utils for OpenRPC.

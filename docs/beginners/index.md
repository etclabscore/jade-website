# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

New to OpenRPC? Youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s start with the big picture.

**OpenRPC is an interface description for JSON-RPC**. It is both human and machine-readable.

Use cases for machine-readable JSON-RPC API definition documents include, but are not limited to:

- specification driven development
- interactive documentation
- code generation 
  - documentation
  - clients
  - servers
- automation of test cases

OpenRPC documents describe a JSON-RPC APIs services and are represented in JSON format. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.

**Right now, thousands of developers all over the world are building protocols that use JSON-RPC, and inventing new kinds of applications, many of which can benefit from OpenRPC today:**

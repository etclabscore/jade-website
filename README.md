  <p>üëã Welcome to open-rpc.org!</p>
</h1>

[open-rpc.org](https://open-rpc.org) is a primary online resource for the OpenRPC community. It is improved and changed over time through the contributions of community members who submit content, give feedback, or volunteer their time to managing its evolution.

If you‚Äôre interested in helping to improve [open-rpc.org](https://open-rpc.org), start here. This contribution guide will help you get started.

<br>

### open-rpc.org‚Äôs design and content is guided by three core principles:

**üåè 1. open-rpc.org is a portal to resources created by the community**
  - It will never be ‚Äúencyclopedia open-rpc‚Äù - we can‚Äôt add every link, or cover every topic
  - Rather, its purpose is to direct people to community-built resources
  - open-rpc.org will always have minimal native-content

**üõ† 2. open-rpc.org is a work in progress, because OpenRPC is a work in progress**
  - We expect it to change over time, including both content and design
  - To accommodate long-term changes, the site has a simple modular structure that will let us add or remove subpages

**üßô 3. open-rpc.org is not a typical product website**
  - open-rpc.org is a representation of our OpenRPC community, and a starting point for those who want to join it, use it, and contribute to it.
  - open-rpc.org should not be a traditional product website. There is no sales pitch.

## How can I contribute?

Keeping in mind the above core principles, there are many ways you can get involved in improving the website!

- Check out the issues page and see if there are any you can help with!
- Submit links to add to specific sections that are incomplete, by submitting a pull-request
- Identify out-of-date information on open-rpc.org (or linked to from open-rpc.org) and submit a pull-request
- Suggest ideas for new subpages, new content, or other ways to improve open-rpc.org by opening an issue.


## Notes on individual sub-pages:

If you want to suggest changes to particular sub-pages, keep in mind the purpose of each page:

### üõ† Developers

- The purpose of this page is to collect core technical resources helpful to someone building on OpenRPC
- Information should be kept as up to date as possible, as new tools appear, standards are adopted, or material is deprecated
- This page will never be completely comprehensive: the goal is to list the most popular or widely used resources or tools.

### üìö Learn

- The purpose of this page is to collect educational material about OpenRPC on a variety of topics
- Some information will be technical in nature, but it will also include non-technical information, or articles that may serve as inspiration to community members

### üì± Use

- This page is for the person who wants to get started using OpenRPC, but doesn‚Äôt know how.

### üëã Beginners

- The purpose of this page is to offer a coherent answer to the most basic questions about OpenRPC: what is it, and why does it exist?
- Because this page is very simple and does not contain much content, changes to the text will be limited.
- Useful contributions include: suggesting better ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù content to link at the bottom of the page, or suggesting images that could be added to the page to break up the text.



## Development

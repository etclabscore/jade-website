## What is JSON-RPC?

[JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is a light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.

It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over http, websockets, or in many various message passing environments.

It uses the JSON data-interchange format. JSON is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language.
